This course is about continuous delivery, or CD, with GitHub Actions. We create two workflows to deploy our app to an AWS S3 bucket automatically. CD is an important part of modern software development, and it has a big meaning. CD is the practice of delivering software faster and with higher quality. To do this, it takes many different practices, behaviors, and technologies. 

In this course, we focus on workflows to deploy pull requests automatically to a staging environment, and to deploy all merged commits to production. In this course, you will:

- Create two workflow files
- Configure AWS S3 for deployment
- Use secrets to store tokens
- Deploy to staging and production
- Practice using GitHub Actions
