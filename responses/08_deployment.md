The deployment may take a few moments but you've done the right thing. Once the deployment is successful, you'll see green check marks for each run, and you'll see a URL for your deployment.

You can wait for the deployment, or move on to the next steps in the [next pull request]({{ url }}). 

If you'd like to come back and merge this once their other workflow is done, you can. :tada:
