# AWS Configuration - S3 Buckets

For deployment, we will be using AWS. 

### S3 Buckets


## Step 5: Confirm AWS S3 configuration

### :keyboard: Activity: Create an AWS account by the following specifications, and confirm here

1. Create an account at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/)
   - _This requires credit card information. If you'd like to continue with the course without an AWS account, Learning Lab will still respond, but none of the deployments will work._
2. [Create an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html)
   - The region needs to be the same as what is specified in the  `aws-config.yml` file in this pull request. :eyes: **For this exercise, choose us-west-2**. :eyes: If you'd like to choose another region, make sure to update the `aws-config.yml` file to match.
